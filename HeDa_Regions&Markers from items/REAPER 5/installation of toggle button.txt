Installation:

This is only for the Toggle button in REAPER 5

	Load all three scripts into the actions window in REAPER.

	For the toggle button in REAPER 5 you have to copy and paste the Command ID string of 
	the "HeDa_Regions & Markers from Items (R5).eel"
	that is found in the actions window in the Command ID column.
	it looks something like this "_468d5e1171a7aa4b8bd657b02809a398";
	right click there and copy command id. Then paste it into the toggle script where it is indicated

		// Installation:
		// PASTE HERE THE Command ID STRING FROM THE "HeDa_Regions & Markers from Items (R5).eel" script
		// COPY IT FROM THE ACTIONS WINDOW
		Command_ID = "_468d5e1171a7aa4b8bd657b02809a398";    
					  ^^^ replace this

	Then add the toolbar button with the "HeDa_Regions & Markers from Items (toggle button).eel" action.

	It should display the toggle state while the script is running in the background.


	For the UI version it is not needed. Just launch the "HeDa_Regions & Markers from Items UI.eel"
